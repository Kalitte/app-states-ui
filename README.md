# UI components for app-states

Change multiple page sections dynamically based on application state. Easily bind url params to your elements.
Designed for single page applications -SPA using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

## Why app-states

app-states allows you to define application states and updatable page sections independently.
With the support of nested states and model inheritance only required sections are updated.
This is the best scenario for real single page applications.

Features
- Declarative application states using web components.
- Nested states supporting inheritance.
- Custom page sections and dynamic content loading.
- Automatic data binding to url params and custom models.
